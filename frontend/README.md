# Frontend readme
This folder contains the Reace Node.js frontend application.

To use this application you will need to do the following steps:

First step, open a command line (like git bash) and change to the project directory

### `cd Documents\Github\csc450-group3-capstone`

From here you will need to change to the appropriate directory, for frontend:

### `cd frontend`

Next, install the required node modules on your workstation (these are not uploaded to GitHub because diskspace).

### `npm install`

You will then need to start the react app using the following command

### `npm start`

You should be able to access the app at this point from your web browser by visiting http://localhost:3000:

### `http://localhost:3000`

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.
