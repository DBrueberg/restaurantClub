# Backend readme
This folder contains the Express Node.js backend application.

To use this application you will need to do the following steps:

First step, open a command line (like git bash) and change to the project directory

### `cd Documents\Github\csc450-group3-capstone`

Second step, change to the backend directory

### `cd backend`

Next, install the required node modules on your workstation (these are not uploaded to GitHub because diskspace).

### `npm install`

You will then need to start the express app using the following command

### `nodemon index`

You should be able to access the various app routes at this point from your web browser by visiting http://localhost:5000/yourRoute, example restaurants:

### `http://localhost:5000/restaurants`
