This project is a restaurant-review/social-media application where users can create and share reviews for their favorite restaurants. Users can create new reviews over time to help let other users know if quality is getting better or worse over time.

This application has the following features:
* It will allow users to log in and create accounts
* Each restaurant will have an "article" feed where users can write articles about their restaurant. This site will not have un-classy messages, if you want to contribute write a tasteful mini article (It's the goal anyway).
* Users with accounts will be able to log in and see their profiles. Dashboard will show links to previously reviewed restaurants and/or newest reviews.
* The user transaction will be creating an account, rating restaurants, and writing articles about them. I believe reviews should change over time so these reviews will be allowed to be changed as well
* Database will hold both user, review, and restaurant information. (user info table, restaurant info table, article table and Normalization will break these into 5+)
